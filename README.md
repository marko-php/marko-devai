# marko/devai

AI-assisted development installer for Marko — wires MCP, LSP, and per-agent configs for Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Copilot, Gemini CLI, and Junie.

## Installation

```bash
composer require marko/devai
```

## Quick Example

```bash
marko devai:install
```

Detects every supported agent present in your environment and writes the correct configuration files for each one in a single pass.

For Claude Code, `devai:install` also offers to install a pinned `intelephense` release globally via npm when it is not already on `PATH`. Pass `--yes` to accept without the prompt, or `--skip-lsp-deps` to skip it.
